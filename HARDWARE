I am using the device from:

http://microcontrollershop.com/product_info.php?products_id=4719

Note the one I have looks different - the CAN interface is isolated and the board is larger.

The frequency settings in the can setup script correspond to this module.

Pin 1, NRST, Reset is left unconnected and is on the upper left.

(RST)	MOSI
CS	INT
Ground	(nc)
MISO	SCLK
5v	3.3v

On the PI, I have them connected to:

		+(corner of the board)
5v	3.3v
x	x
x	Ground
x	x
...
x	x
MOSI	x
MISO	INT
SCLK	CS
